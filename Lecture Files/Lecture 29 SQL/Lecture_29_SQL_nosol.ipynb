The queries in these systems use standard SQL with only slight changes, but the search for the answer to the query is distributed across many servers, allowing a very parallel search for the query results.  The speed requires several optimizations in how the data is stored, such as storing the columns together in storage instead of storing complete records together.  But the user only needs to know the SQL commands to successfully use it.\n",
