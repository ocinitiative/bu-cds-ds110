Naming an attribute with two leading underscores says it's *really* not meant to be accessed except by the class, and Python will \"mangle\" the name of the variable by adding _ClassName to it just to help ensure it's not accessed by accident.  But in all cases, unlike in other languages (C++,Java), there's no way to absolutely prevent attributes from being accessed."
