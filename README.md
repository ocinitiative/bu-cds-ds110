# CDS DS 110 - Introduction to Data Science with Python

## Course Description

DS 110 is the first in a two-course sequence (including DS 210) that builds studentsâ€™ competence in computing techniques central to data science.
In DS 110, students will use Python to explore many of the fundamental computer science concepts and processes used in data science. This begins with core computer science topics such as data structures, development of functions and recursion, and leads to topics including object oriented programming and data visualization.

In terms of Python tools for data science, students will learn how to work with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze real-world data.

The sequence of DS 110 and 210 works in concert with the 120-121-122 series: as students develop their expertise in the mathematical foundations covered in 120-121-122, they build their abilities to implement those tools and manage actual datasets in the 110-120 sequence.

## Hub Learning Outcomes

### Quantitative Reasoning I (QR1) Learning Outcomes:
Students will be introduced to the Python programming language. Students will learn how to use pure Python to write basic functional and object-oriented programs. Students will also learn about core data science libraries such as numpy and pandas and, by the end of the course, students will be able to use these tools to produce descriptive analyses and visualizations of different datasets.

In parallel to learning Python for data science, students will develop and demonstrate their understanding of core concepts in computer science, and their ability to use them to manipulate different types of data. Students will learn about basic CS topics such as algorithms, big-O notation and algorithm runtime, object oriented programming methods, parallel computing, and networking.

Students will master the fundamentals of programming in Python for data science, including learning how to use common libraries such numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Using these tools, students will build basic models of the data to uncover and interpret interesting patterns in real- world data.

Students will learn to communicate the findings of their analyses both verbally and as part of a presentation using summary statistics, tabulations, and visualizations.

### Teamwork/Collaboration Learning Outcomes:
Students will form teams of 2-4 to complete a half-semester-long project. Students will be provided with feedback and guidance on teamwork by the course instructor, including how to promote team and individual accountability, set expectations, and how to schedule meetings regularly and make meetings effective.
