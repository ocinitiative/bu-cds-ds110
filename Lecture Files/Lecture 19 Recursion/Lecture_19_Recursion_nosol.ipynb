Arguably an example of this is computing the power set, or set of all possible subsets, of a set.  Given an arbitrary \"first\" element of the set, A, the power set contains all subsets that contain A and all subsets that don't contain A.  For example, the power set containing {'a','b'} is equal to those subsets that contain 'a' ({'a'},{'a','b'}) combined with the subsets that don't contain 'a' ({'b'},empty set).  This leads to the recursive approach of computing the power set without the first element, then computing the overall power set as two copies of that smaller subset, one of which has element A added to everything."
