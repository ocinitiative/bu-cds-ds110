# CDS DS 110 - Introduction to Data Science with Python

## Course Description

DS 110 is the first in a two-course sequence (including DS 210) that builds studentsâ€™ competence in computing techniques central to data science.
In DS 110, students will use Python to explore many of the fundamental computer science concepts and processes used in data science. This begins with core computer science topics such as data structures, development of functions and recursion, and leads to topics including object oriented programming and data visualization.

In terms of Python tools for data science, students will learn how to work with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze real-world data.

The sequence of DS 110 and 210 works in concert with the 120-121-122 series: as students develop their expertise in the mathematical foundations covered in 120-121-122, they build their abilities to implement those tools and manage actual datasets in the 110-120 sequence.
